# Hand/Finger Testing Battery - Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

This SOP provides a procedure for conducting a hand/finger testing battery, which consists of Finger Tapping, Force Matching, Absolute Force Measurement, Joint Position Sense (JPS), and Vibrotactile Discrimination tests.

## Participant Preparation
- Prior to any testing, the participant should understand the purpose and the procedures of the tests. 
- Make certain the participant is comfortable. 
- For CONTROLS - use dominant hand for testing
- i.e., for goniometer JSP task, the dominant hand is the one enacting the proprioceptive (mimic) task. The dominant hand taps, does force, and force matching, and vibros
-  For MND - MORE affected side (by self report). NB this is not ONSET side necessarily.

## Finger Tapping Test
- **Objective:** To assess finger motor speed and coordination.
- **Procedure:** 
    - Inform the participant they will be rapidly tapping a key on a computer using each finger in succession.
    - Instruct the participant to place the finger to be tested on the keyboard's space bar.
    - Their hand should be flat on the table, it is ok if other fingers are on the other keys or depressing them
    - Initiate the program (Finger tip Tapping) that counts the taps 
- **Scoring:** The program will save the data to a csv file.

## Force Matching Test
- **Objective:** To assess the ability to perceive and reproduce grip force.
- **Procedure:** 
    - Explain to the participant that they will grip the dynamometer until it registers a target force (either 5 or 10 kilos), then try to replicate that force with eyes closed.
    - Participant squeezes the dynamometer to the target force with their eyes open, noting the sensation.
    - Remember to press 'start' on the dynamometer at each trial
    - **THE EXPERIMENTER will hold the dynamometer.** Assistance may be required to assist with the correct weight. 
    - Participant then closes their eyes and squeezes the dynamometer to reproduce the force sensation.
    - Participant says "stop" when they believe they've matched the force.
- **Scoring:** Record the force value on the dynamometer at the time when participant says "stop". Compute the difference from the target force to get the error score.

## Absolute Force Measurement
- **Objective:** To assess the maximum voluntary contraction force.
- **Procedure:** 
    - Explain to the participant that they will squeeze the dynamometer as hard as they can.
    - Participant grips the dynamometer in their hand and applies the maximum amount of force they can muster.
    - For each fingethrip, **THE EXPERIMENTER will hold the dynamometer.**
    - For each finger, a pincer grip must be employed, pulling the dynamometer down with the relevant finger
- **Scoring:** Record the peak force displayed on the dynamometer. Repeat the test for each finger and hand. Press start each time.

## Joint Position Sense Test
- **Objective:** To assess the sense of position of the joints in the fingers.
- **Procedure:** 
    - Explain to the participant that they will attempt to match a finger position you set using their other hand.
    - Using a finger goniometer, adjust one of the participant's fingers on their non-dominant hand to a specific position.
    - Alternatively, allow them to find a position that is comfortable.
    - Measuring from the middle of the knuckle on the relevant finger, measure the angle
    - Measure and record the exact angle using the goniometer without revealing the measurement to the participant.
    - Participant then replicates the position with the corresponding finger on the dominant hand.
    - Repeat twice for each finger (10 trials total)
- **Scoring:** Measure and record the angle of the replicated position and calculate the difference from the initial measurement.

## Vibrotactile Discrimination Test
- **Objective:** To assess the ability to discern changes in the vibration applied to each finger.
- **Procedure:** 
    - Explain to the participant that they will be detecting changes in the vibration applied to each finger.
    - There is a practice run (up to 3) before the run. 
    - Apply a stimulus to the participant's finger using a piezotactile stimulator.
    - Use behavioural-tactile script. 4 blocks of about 7 mins each.
    - Ptp must press "enter" after each response.
- **Scoring:** Script will score and plot psychometric function for each finger. Save results.

## Post-Testing
- Thank the participant for their participation.
- Ensure participant comfort at all times and note fatigue

---

## Safety and Ethical Considerations
- Always ensure participant comfort and understanding of each test.
- Maintain ethical standards including obtaining informed consent and ensuring participant's right to withdraw at any point.
- Address any adverse reactions or events during testing, particularly fatigue.
